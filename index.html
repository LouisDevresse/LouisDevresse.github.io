            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>
              My name is Louis Devresse, and I am currently a PhD student at the
              Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (<a
                class="textlink"
                href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/"
                >CEFE</a
              >) in Montpellier. My research focuses on
              <strong>evolution</strong>
              in <strong>multi-species contexts</strong>, bridging theoretical
              approaches with more "realistic",
              <strong>process-based models</strong> used to predict how species
              will respond to <strong>climate change</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my PhD, I have integrated evolutionary processes into
              mechanistic models that simulate forest dynamics and how forests
              respond to climate variations. A central question in my work is
              understanding how
              <strong>interspecific interactions</strong> between trees, such as
              competition for water and light, affect their ability to adapt to
              climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking ahead, I am interested in exploring how
              <strong>community dynamics</strong>
              and the properties of species-rich communities can influence
              species adaptation to environmental changes from a
              microevolutionary perspective, or even shape speciation and
              extinction dynamics at a more macroevolutionary scale. If you are
              interested in collaborating or would like to discuss potential
              projects, please don't hesitate to

                  <p class="abstract">
                    Questions have been raised about the ability of long-lived
                    organisms, such as trees, to adapt to rapid climate change,
                    and to what extent forest management actions influence the
                    evolutionary responses of tree species. Given the life
                    history of trees and the time scales involved, these
                    questions are often addressed through modeling approaches.
                    Yet, most of these studies focus on single-species case
                    studies. The main objective and originality of our work is
                    to explore the evolutionary responses of tree species to
                    climate change using a process-based model, in a
                    multi-specific context. This approach allows us to
                    investigate the conditions necessary for evolutionary rescue
                    in a mixed beech–fir forest. Furthermore, we explored how
                    climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions, such as
                    assisted gene flow and assisted migration, affect the
                    conditions for evolutionary rescue in this forest type. To
                    achieve these objectives, we integrated a quantitative
                    genetic module into a process-based forest gap model,
                    enabling species-specific parameters to evolve as
                    quantitative traits under selective pressure and drift. Our
                    results show that increased trait variability and
                    heritability reduce the loss of forest cover following
                    climatic warming in the short term (over a century). We also
                    found that assisted gene flow had the expected effect of
                    aiding species adapt to climate change. Finally, our study
                    suggests that introducing new pre-adapted species into the
                    forest could improve recovery after climate change but could
                    also hinder the evolutionary rescue of local species. We
                    conclude that integrating evolutionary dynamics into
                    process-based models significantly enhances their predictive
                    power by incorporating genetic adaptation scenarios that
                    would otherwise be overlooked. This approach also allows us
                    to test eco-evolutionary hypotheses and better understand
                    the potential consequences of adaptation measures to climate
                    change for tree species.

                    Climate change impacts forest functioning and dynamics, but
                    large uncertainties remain regarding the interactions
                    between species composition, demographic processes and
                    environmental drivers. While the effects of changing
                    climates on individual plant processes are well studied, few
                    tools dynamically integrate them, which precludes accurate
                    projections and recommendations for long-term sustainable
                    forest management. Forest gap models present a balance
                    between complexity and generality and are widely used in
                    predictive forest ecology, but their lack of explicit
                    representation of some of the processes most sensitive to
                    climate changes, like plant phenology and water use, puts
                    into question the relevance of their predictions. Therefore,
                    integrating trait- and process-based representations of
                    climate-sensitive processes is key to improving predictions
                    of forest dynamics under climate change. In this study, we
                    describe the PHOREAU model, a new semi-empirical forest
                    dynamic model resulting from the coupling of a gap model
                    (FORCEEPS), with two process-based models: a phenology-based
                    species distribution model (PHENOFIT) and a plant hydraulics
                    model (SurEAU), each parametrized for the main European
                    species. The performance of the resulting PHOREAU model was
                    then evaluated over many processes, metrics and time-scales,
                    from the ecophysiology of individuals to the biogeography of
                    species. PHOREAU reliably predicted fine hydraulic processes
                    at both the forest and stand scale for a variety of species
                    and forest types. This, alongside an improved capacity to
                    predict stand leaf areas from inventories, resulted in
                    better annual growth compared to ForCEEPS, and a strong
                    ability to predict potential community compositions. By
                    integrating recent advancements in plant hydraulic,
                    phenology, and competition for light and water into a
                    dynamic, individual-based framework, the PHOREAU model,
                    developed on the Capsis platform, can be used to understand
                    complex emergent properties and trade-offs linked to
                    diversity-effects effects under extreme climatic events,
                    with implications for sustainable forest management
                    strategies.

                    Plant–pollinator interactions evolved early in the
                    angiosperm radiation. Ongoing environmental changes are
                    however leading to pollinator declines that may cause pollen
                    limitation to plants and change the evolutionary pressures
                    shaping plant mating systems. We used resurrection ecology
                    methodology to contrast ancestors and contemporary
                    descendants in four natural populations of the field pansy
                    (Viola arvensis) in the Paris region (France), a depauperate
                    pollinator environment. We combine population genetics
                    analysis, phenotypic measurements and behavioural tests on a
                    common garden experiment. Population genetics analysis
                    reveals 27% increase in realized selfing rates in the field
                    during this period. We documented trait evolution towards
                    smaller and less conspicuous corollas, reduced nectar
                    production and reduced attractiveness to bumblebees, with
                    these trait shifts convergent across the four studied
                    populations. We demonstrate the rapid evolution of a selfing
                    syndrome in the four studied plant populations, associated
                    with a weakening of the interactions with pollinators over
                    the last three decades. This study demonstrates that plant
                    mating systems can evolve rapidly in natural populations in
                    the face of ongoing environmental changes. The rapid
                    evolution towards a selfing syndrome may in turn further
                    accelerate pollinator declines, in an eco-evolutionary
                    feedback loop with broader implications to natural
                    ecosystems.
